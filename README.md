# Credit Card Fraud Detection

[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) is a highly unbalanced
dataset consisting of 492 fraud and 284,807 transactions. Every record in data frame has 30 features
which are:
  - _Time_: the number of seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction;
  - _Amount_: the transaction amount;
  - _V1_, _V2_, _..._, _V28_: generated by PCA features of transaction.

Residual neural network was built as classifier. The NN consists of 6 fully connected layers and 2
shortcuts connections. Here is its structure:

The model is saved in `model.h5` file.  
Test accuracy of model is 0.93, ROC AUC is 0.97 and F1-Score is 0.93.

The project is completed using [DVC](https://dvc.org/). There are 3 stages in total:  
  - __stages/split.dvc__ - Pre-process the dataset: removes column _Time_, creates _RobustScaler_
  and use it on column _Amount_, split dataset into train and test with test_size=0.2;
  - __stages/train.dvc__ - Trains the model and saves it to _data/model.h5_ for DVC and to 
  _model.h5_ for Git;
  - __stages/evaluate.dvc__ - Evaluates the model via test dataset. Outputs accuracy, ROC AUC score
   and F1-Score. Saves all metrics to _metrics.txt_, so later you can view them using `dvd metrics
   show`.

There is a visualisation of whole pipeline of __stages/evaluate.dvc__ below:
